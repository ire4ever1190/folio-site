    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>You could probably tell by the tagline before but I'm Jake. I'm a normal human <span class="spoiler">(not a robot ðŸ¤–)</span>  who
       enjoys walks, <span title="Mainly Sci-Fi">reading</span>, watching <span title="TODO: Pay cat tax">my cats</span> loaf
       and of course, programming.</p>
     <p>I got into programming as a hobby around the middle of highschool when I used it for small tasks like</p>
     <ul>
         <li>Automated messages for when data usage was too high</li>
         <li>Displaying my timetable in a <a href="https://www.rainmeter.net/">Rainmeter</a> widget</li>
         <li>Calculating my average school results</li>
     </ul>
     <p>And from there I just kept programming and doing random stuff until eventually I decided I
        wanted to make a career out of it</p>
